# java8-watch-service
 WatchService "watcher" for the file system. 

Steps for Watch Service to work:
1 Register for only single directory to watch (we can do for multiple directories)
2 Traverse for directories, sub-directories, and files
3 Watching for all the change events like create/delete/modify
